# School 42 Pool August 2024
Exercises carried out during the C programming language pool in August 2024 at Escuela 42 Málaga by Fundación Telefónica.

## 📖 About
- It is an intensive programming bootcamp that lasts 26 days. During this time, participants work on projects using the C programming language, applying a peer-to-peer learning methodology. 
In addition to C, students also work with technologies such as shell (Linux/Unix) and git. 
- Throughout the program, essential soft skills are developed, such as teamwork, autonomous learning, efficient time management and resilience.
- Passing this bootcamp is a fundamental requirement to be able to access the full course on the programming campus.

## Technology
📁 **GIT**</br>
All projects must be uploaded to a git repository to be evaluated.

💻 **SHELL**</br>
The first days of the pool, two Shell exercises are carried out to learn the basic commands, in this way, we develop the ability to move around the terminal in a fast and efficient way, create scripts, know the commands Shell, environment variables, file system,...

🧠 **C programming language**</br>
It is the main programming language with which we are going to work. It is necessary to master control structures, variables, all types of operators, libraries, pointers, arrays, functions,...

## 💡 Soft-skills
👨‍🎓 **Self-learning**
School 42 uses the peer to peer learning methodology. Students share their knowledge, search for resources online or in manuals.

👥 **TEAM-WORK**
There are some projects that are carried out in teams randomly with candidates where they must collaborate to find an answer to a challenge. To do this, they will have to pool their knowledge, which will surely be very unequal; support each other and find a work methodology that helps you complete the project.

⏱️ **ADMINISTRATION OF TIME**
The pool is open 24 hours a day, so it is necessary to manage attendance time. In addition, you will have to prioritize some projects or stop to continue moving forward and not fall behind.

🧘 **Resilience**
It is necessary to face situations with emotional intelligence and empathy towards colleagues. And your mental health and metabolism is balanced during the process.
